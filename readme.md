### todo now
* run a timer on the server (with setInterval?)
  * sync the timer between client and server.
* maintain a queue of videos.
  * allow users to rearrange the queue (with jQueryUI?)
* when the timer ends, load the next video in the queue.

### todo later
* authenticate users against a database?
